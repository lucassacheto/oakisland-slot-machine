# THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND SLOT MACHINE PROJECT

[LIVE DEMO](https://oakisland-slot-machine.vercel.app/)

<sub>The slot machine does not use real money<br>

## WHY
This is a fan project that I made to challenge myself coding a game.

<b>What I used</b>:
- JavaScript
- React (for score states only)
- SVG animation for BIG WIN and EPIC

## KNOWING ISSUES
- Safari does not load the images at first
- It takes too long to run the next spin


## FEATURES AND IDEAS TO COME
- More sounds for specific characters
- Bonus round? That's a challenging one
- Increase bet to get more chance - The final points will be equivalent
- Responsive design for mobile
